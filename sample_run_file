-t 1 -x "free; echo; free -h; echo; top -b -n 1 -c -p $(pgrep -f watchplus | head -n 20 | paste -d, -s -)"

#1  best to just use dmesg, not dmesg -w (follow). avoid using tail, it's not needed, use -b
#2  this is a good example of when to use the -s for streaming. watchplus will let the command run and collect new output
#3  don't use streaming here, because it outputs once and quits (-c1). without -s watchplus will repeate the command every iteration, just like the watch command

# -s --streaming  For use with continual streaming commands such as tcpdump and ping.
# -b --bottom     Start this tab at the bottom of the output, similar to follow option.
# -x --change     Do not display change history. Can be toggled on/off with 'x'.
